# ohpygossh

A project to create a new cross-platform SSH wheel for Python.

<img width="617" alt="image" src="docs/assets/banner.png">

## Goals

1. An easy to install, multi-platform SSH wheel
1. To explore [`gopy`](https://github.com/go-python/gopy)

## Code of Conduct

1. Respect and give kudos to all the work that's come
before.
    1. In particular, the Herculean efforts of [`gopy`], [`paramiko`] and [`asyncssh`].
    1. Please also be kind to all other open-source software projects you find.

It is paramount that we all play nicely.  To that end, please do your very best
not to create churn or spur conversations that may upset other developers,
and/or cause debate without offering solutions.

## Usage

Install the library:

```bash
pip install ohpygossh
```

Import and use the library to perform SSH operations:

```python
from ohpygossh.gohpygossh import Run, Upload, Download

# SSH connection parameters
#
# The remote hostname or IP address
ssh_server = "example.com"
# Your user account on the remote machine
ssh_user = "ubuntu"
# A PEM encoded private key file (like ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 )
private_key = "/path/to/private/key"

# Execute a command on a remote host
output = Run(ssh_server, ssh_user, private_key, "ls -la")

# Upload a file to the remote host
Upload(ssh_server, ssh_user, private_key, "/local/file.txt", "/remote/file.txt")

# Download a file from the remote host
Download(ssh_server, ssh_user, private_key, "/remote/file.txt", "/local/file.txt")
```

## Development

⚠️ This section needs to be rewritten ⚠️

### Build wheel

The following steps should produce a wheel,
located at `dist/ohpygossh-<version>-py3-none-any.whl`

```bash
./make_and_validate_script.sh
```

### Naming

This project has to think about naming in two different contexts:

* The Python library, installed by end-users: `ohpygossh`.
* The Golang package, also used in the `pyproject.toml`: `gohpygossh`.

Briefly:

```python
# Install the library:
#   pip install ohpygossh

# Import functions and data structures
from ohpygossh.gohpygossh import ...
```
