# gopy and goimports versions are pinned in go.mod (as Go 1.24+ tool
# dependencies) and managed there by Dependabot; every consumer derives them
# from go.mod at recipe run-time (not parse-time -- `setup` is what installs
# Go, so a top-level `:=` variable would need Go before it exists) so there
# is exactly one place to bump each.
#
# Go itself is pinned to the go@1.25 Homebrew formula (matching go.mod's `go
# 1.25.0` and the Go version CI pins via actions/setup-go) rather than the
# rolling `go` formula. go@1.25 is keg-only, so every recipe that shells out
# to `go` (directly, or indirectly via pre-commit's golangci-lint hook, which
# always builds golangci-lint from source against whatever `go` is on PATH)
# must prepend its bin dir to PATH itself. Letting the rolling `go` formula
# drift ahead (e.g. to 1.27) previously reintroduced a golangci-lint/
# honnef.co/go/tools panic when linting this repo.
